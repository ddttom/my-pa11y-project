Run markdown linting and fix all issues in the repository.

Execute the following steps:

1. Run `npm run lint:md:fix` to automatically fix all markdown linting issues
2. Run `npm run lint:md` to verify all issues are resolved
3. Report any remaining issues that couldn't be auto-fixed
4. Show a summary of files that were modified

If there are any errors that couldn't be auto-fixed, provide guidance on how to fix them manually based on the rules in markdown-lint.md.
