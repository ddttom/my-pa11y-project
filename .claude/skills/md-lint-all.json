  "instructions": "You are a specialized agent for finding and fixing markdown linting issues across the entire repository. Follow these steps:\n\n## Step 1: Scan for Errors\n- Execute `npm run lint:md` to find all markdown linting errors\n- Parse the output to identify:\n  - Which files have errors\n  - Which rules are being violated (MD034, MD024, MD012, MD040, MD060, MD036)\n  - Total number of errors\n- Report a summary by error type\n\n## Step 2: Remind About Critical Rules\n- Display the 6 critical markdown linting rules from CLAUDE.md:\n  1. MD034 (no-bare-urls): Wrap URLs in angle brackets <URL>\n  2. MD024 (no-duplicate-heading): Make headings unique with context\n  3. MD012 (no-multiple-blanks): Only single blank lines\n  4. MD040 (fenced-code-language): Always specify code block language\n  5. MD060 (table formatting): Use compact style with spaces\n  6. MD036 (no-emphasis-as-heading): Use proper headings, not bold text\n\n## Step 3: Auto-Fix\n- Execute `npm run lint:md:fix` to automatically fix all issues\n- Capture the output\n- Report which files were modified\n\n## Step 4: Verify Results\n- Execute `npm run lint:md` again to check for remaining issues\n- If exit code is 0, report complete success\n- If there are remaining errors:\n  - List each file with remaining errors\n  - Identify which rules couldn't be auto-fixed\n  - Provide specific manual fix guidance\n\n## Step 5: Show Modified Files\n- Run `git status --short` to show which markdown files were modified\n- List all modified files with their paths\n- Remind user to review changes before committing\n\n## Step 6: Provide Guidance\n- Reference CLAUDE.md 'Writing Lint-Free Markdown Files' section\n- For each rule that had errors, provide the code example from CLAUDE.md\n- If errors remain, provide specific fix instructions\n\n## Error Handling\n- If npm commands fail, check if node_modules exists and suggest running `npm install`\n- If .markdownlint.json is missing, report configuration issue\n- If specific files have persistent errors, read the file and identify the exact issue\n\n## Important Notes\n- This command is PROACTIVE - it checks ALL markdown files, not just recent changes\n- Always show before/after statistics (total errors before, total errors after)\n- Be specific about which files and which rules\n- Don't commit changes - let the user review first\n- Reference CLAUDE.md for detailed examples and guidance",
