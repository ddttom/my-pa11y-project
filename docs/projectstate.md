# Project State

[Product Requirements](prd.md) | [User Manual](usermanual.md)

## Current Status

### Core Functionality

✅ URL Processing

- Successfully processes URLs from sitemap (18 URLs processed)
- Handles all URL formats (absolute, relative, protocol-relative)
- Validates and normalizes URLs
- Default site configured (allabout.network)

⚠️ Analysis Features

- SEO analysis (scores not being written to CSV)
- Performance metrics (load time and paint metrics working)
- Accessibility testing (Pa11y working, no issues found)
- Content analysis (data in results.json but not in reports)
- Link structure analysis (data collected but not in reports)

⚠️ Output Generation

- SEO report CSV (all fields showing "Missing" or "0")
- Performance analysis CSV (metrics working, missing page size/resources)
- SEO scores CSV (all scores showing "0")
- Virtual/final sitemaps (18 URLs mapped)
- Results JSON (complete with all metrics)
- Logging (working with debug level)

### Recent Improvements

- Data collection working (stored in results.json)
- Added retry logic for report generation
- Added validation for required data
- Added robust URL handling
- Improved error recovery
- Enhanced logging system

## Known Issues

1. SEO Report (seo_report.csv):
   - All fields showing "Missing" or "0" despite data in results.json
   - Title and meta description available but not being written
   - Link counts available but not being written

2. Performance Analysis (performance_analysis.csv):
   - Page size and resource count added from results.json
   - Load time metrics: 101-125ms
   - Paint metrics: 412-700ms

3. Data Collection:
   - Data collection working but not being written to reports:
     - Meta tags (title, description) present in results.json
     - Image data (count, alt, dimensions) present in results.json
     - Link counts present in results.json
     - SEO scores present in results.json

## Next Steps

1. Fix data extraction:
   - Fix report generation to use data from results.json
   - Fix SEO scores extraction from results.json
   - Fix data mapping in generateSeoReport()

2. Improve reports:
   - Add data validation for required fields
   - Add error handling for missing metrics
   - Add detailed reporting of data quality

3. Enhance error handling:
   - Add retry logic for failed data extraction
   - Add validation for required data fields
   - Add detailed logging of data quality

- HTML parsing: ✅ (data being collected)
- Data extraction: ✅ (stored in results.json)
- Report generation: ⚠️ (improved but needs validation)
- Error handling: ✅ (logging working)
