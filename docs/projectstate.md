- Performance metrics (load time, paint metrics, etc.)
- Accessibility testing (Pa11y integration with detailed reporting)
  - WCAG 2.1 compliance tracking
  - Enhanced issue categorization by severity and impact
  - Required manual checks tracking
  - Improved remediation suggestions
- Content analysis (headings, freshness, media richness)
- Link structure analysis (internal/external links with quality scores)
- Image optimization analysis (complete with recommendations)
- Security analysis (HTTPS, headers, vulnerabilities)

✅ **Report Generation**

- SEO report (all key metrics and scores)
- Performance analysis (comprehensive metrics)
- SEO scores (weighted scoring with detailed breakdown)
- Accessibility report (WCAG 2.1 compliance, issues by severity and guideline)
- Image optimization report (detailed analysis with recommendations)
- Link analysis report (complete link structure analysis)
- Content quality report (structure and freshness scoring)
- Security report (full security feature analysis)
