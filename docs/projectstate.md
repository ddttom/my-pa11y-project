## Current Status

### Core Functionality

✅ **URL Processing**

- Successfully processes URLs from sitemap
- Handles all URL formats (absolute, relative, protocol-relative)
- Validates and normalizes URLs
- Implemented caching for better performance
- Enhanced network error handling with retry mechanism
- Automatic .cache directory creation during initialization
- Added count parameter to limit number of URLs processed
- Preserves existing output directory contents
- Added results.json detection for report generation
- Implemented configurable sampling limits for testing
- Added language variant filtering (skip non-English variants by default)
  - Only processes /en and /us variants by default
  - Can be overridden with --include-all-languages flag

✅ **Analysis Features**

- SEO analysis (complete analysis with weighted scoring)
- Performance metrics (load time, paint metrics, etc.)
- Accessibility testing (Pa11y integration with detailed reporting)
  - WCAG 2.1 compliance tracking
  - Enhanced issue categorization by severity and impact
  - Required manual checks tracking

  - Added markdown report format for better readability
- Content analysis (headings, freshness, media richness)
- Link structure analysis (internal/external links with quality scores)
- Image optimization analysis (complete with recommendations)
- Security analysis (HTTPS, headers, vulnerabilities)

✅ **Report Generation**

- SEO report (all key metrics and scores)
- Performance analysis (comprehensive metrics)
- SEO scores (weighted scoring with detailed breakdown)
