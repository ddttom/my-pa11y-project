# Project State Overview

## Current Architecture

### Core Components

1. **index.js** (Main Entry Point)
   - Handles CLI argument parsing using commander
   - Manages logging configuration with winston
   - Orchestrates the main auditing process
   - Implements configuration options from auditcore.options
   - Calls runTestsOnSitemap() from src/main.js

2. **sitemap.js** (Sitemap Processing)
   - Processes both XML and HTML sitemaps
   - Implements URL validation and normalization
   - Provides recursive crawling for HTML sitemaps
   - Integrates with Puppeteer for dynamic content extraction
   - Includes caching mechanism for HTML content
   - Generates virtual XML sitemaps

3. **caching.js** (Caching System)
   - Implements file-based caching with MD5 hashing
   - Provides content freshness analysis
   - Supports both Puppeteer and non-Puppeteer data collection
   - Handles cache directory management
   - Implements cache invalidation strategies

4. **Configuration (src/config/readme.md)**
   - Documents available auditcore.options
   - Defines configuration parameters for:
     - Sitemap handling
     - Output locations
     - Processing limits
     - Caching behavior
     - Puppeteer execution
     - Logging levels

## Current State

### Completed Functionality
