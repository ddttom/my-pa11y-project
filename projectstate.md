## Cache System

The `.cache` directory uses MD5 hashing for filenames:

```
.cache/
  ├── be3b1dc7348a079bdab9443dc804c741.json
  ├── b72b97c79a50c857ae0d684b9125aa24.json
  ├── 028671fcf192b30bfb8b8a3cb293830f.json
  └── ...
```

Cache is used to:

- Reduce server load during crawling
- Speed up repeated scans
- Support interrupted crawl recovery
- Store HTML content and processing results
